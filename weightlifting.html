            <h2>CrossFit is a high-intensity, strength, and conditioning workout that<br>
                consists of a wide variety of functional movements – many of which you<br> 
                would perform daily throughout your everyday life (e.g., pushing, pulling,<br>
                squatting, sitting up, etc.)
                 <h1>WHY CROSSFIT WORKS?.</h1>
            <h2>CrossFit workouts include variations of these movements with a strong focus<br>
                on load, distance, and speed. Each exercise typically lasts a set period or<br>
                until a certain amount of work has been completed.CrossFit workouts are<br>
                different each day, and Our Trainers can modify every exercise according <br>
                to an individual’s ability regardless of their age and fitness levels.</h2>
            <h1>BENEFITS</h1>
            <h2>CrossFit works because it is for everyone! From the fittest athletes in the world<br>
                to people who have never even stepped into a CrossFit gym! Everyone in a CrossFit<br>
                class does the same “WOD” no matter their technical ability or strength.<br>
                Each workout is scalable and can be modified according to your capabilities.<br>
                If you can’t do a pull, you can use an elastic band to help you; if you can’t<br>
                do a weighted squat, you can use your body weight.</h2>
